# Welcome to the Virtual Chemistry Lab!

This game is designed to give you a hands-on experience in performing chemistry experiments, such as soap-making and aspirin synthesis, in a safe and engaging virtual environment. Whether you’re a student, an aspiring chemist, or simply curious about chemistry, this lab is here to spark your curiosity and deepen your understanding of scientific principles.

## Before You Start: Safety First!

Safety is a critical aspect of every chemistry experiment. Even though this is a virtual lab, understanding and practicing safety protocols will prepare you for real-world lab work.

Here are some essential safety rules to follow in the game (and in real life):

- Always Wear Personal Protective Equipment

- Handle Chemicals with Care

- Be Aware of Potential Hazards

- Practice Precision

- Emergency Protocols

## Motivation for Building This Game

As both a chemist and a software engineer, this game is my way of bringing two worlds I love —science and technology— together.

In real-world chemistry labs, conducting experiments involves handling potentially hazardous chemicals, delicate procedures, and precise measurements. However, not everyone has access to a fully equipped lab or the opportunity to learn in a controlled environment.


My motivation for creating this game is to:

Make Chemistry Accessible: Provide students with an opportunity to learn and practice experiments without needing physical lab resources.

Promote Safe Practices: Teach students essential safety rules and protocols in a risk-free setting, preparing them for real-life lab environments.

Enhance Learning Through Interactivity: Turn theoretical concepts into practical applications by letting students interact with tools, chemicals, and reactions.

Encourage Exploration: Allow students to experiment freely, fostering curiosity and a deeper appreciation for the science of chemistry.

Support Sustainable Learning: Minimize waste and environmental impact by offering a virtual platform instead of physical experiments.
