## Safety First

Safety is a critical aspect of every chemistry experiment. Even though this is a virtual lab, understanding and practicing safety protocols will prepare you for real-world lab work. Please keep these guidelines in mind:

- **Always Wear Personal Protective Equipment**  
- **Handle Chemicals with Care**  
- **Know the Hazards**  
- **Precision Matters**    
- **Emergency Protocols**

## Motivation

As a chemist and software engineer, I wanted to merge two passions: science and technology.

In real-world chemistry labs, conducting experiments involves handling potentially hazardous chemicals, delicate procedures, and precise measurements. However, not everyone has access to a fully equipped lab or the opportunity to learn in a controlled environment.
- **Make Chemistry Accessible**  
  Provide students with an opportunity to learn and practice experiments without needing physical lab resources.  
- **Promote Safe Practices**  
  Teach students essential safety rules and protocols in a risk-free setting, preparing them for real-life lab environments.
- **Enhance Learning Through Interactivity**  
  Turn theoretical concepts into memorable, hands-on virtual experiments.  
- **Encourage Exploration**  
  Foster curiosity by allowing users to try different approaches and see real-time outcomes.  
- **Support Sustainable Learning**  
  Minimize waste and environmental impact by offering a virtual platform instead of physical experiments.
